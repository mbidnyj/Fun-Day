## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file in the `/app` directory** with the following:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=your_11labs_api_key
   ELEVEN_LABS_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id

## How It Works

1. Users select their preferred joke topics and delivery time.  
2. A cron job runs hourly to check for scheduled deliveries.  
3. For each scheduled delivery:
   - Generates personalized jokes using OpenAI  
   - Converts text to speech using 11Labs  
   - Sends email with audio attachment via SendGrid
